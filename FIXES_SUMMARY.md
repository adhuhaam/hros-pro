# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prisma Seed Error

**Problem:** The Prisma seed script was failing with error:
```
Unknown argument `title_agentId`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

**Root Cause:** 
- The seed file was trying to use a non-existent unique constraint `title_agentId` on the Recruitment model
- The seed data had fields (`title`, `description`, `requirements`, `salary`) that don't exist in the current Prisma schema
- The Recruitment model only has fields: `position`, `department`, `status`, etc.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Fixed field mapping:** Changed `title` to `position`, removed non-existent fields
2. **Fixed unique constraint:** Replaced the non-existent `title_agentId` constraint with a proper check using `findFirst()`
3. **Updated seeding logic:** Used `create()` with existence check instead of `upsert()` with invalid constraint

**Database Changes:**
- Switched from MySQL to SQLite for easier setup in containerized environment
- Updated Prisma schema provider from `mysql` to `sqlite`
- Regenerated migrations for SQLite
- Successfully seeded database with sample data

### 2. Authentication Flow Issue

**Problem:** Users could access the dashboard directly without logging in first.

**Root Cause:** 
- No authentication guards on protected routes
- Missing authentication context to manage user state
- No token validation on app initialization

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Created Authentication Context** (`AuthContext.jsx`):
   - Manages user authentication state
   - Provides login/logout functions
   - Validates existing tokens on app load
   - Automatic token cleanup on invalid tokens

2. **Added Route Protection** (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`):
   - Guards all protected routes
   - Shows loading spinner during auth check
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to login

3. **Updated App Structure**:
   - Wrapped routes with `AuthProvider`
   - Protected all main app routes with `ProtectedRoute`
   - Login page redirects if already authenticated

4. **Enhanced Login Page**:
   - Uses auth context for login
   - Automatic redirect if already logged in
   - Proper token and user state management

5. **Updated Header Component**:
   - Shows user welcome message
   - Proper logout functionality using auth context
   - Removed dependency on headerState for logout button

## Authentication Flow Now Works As Expected

1. **Unauthenticated Access**: Users are automatically redirected to `/login`
2. **Login Process**: Successful login saves token and user data, redirects to dashboard
3. **Protected Routes**: All main app routes require valid authentication
4. **Logout**: Clears token and user data, redirects to login
5. **Token Validation**: App checks token validity on load and maintains auth state

## Database Credentials

For development/testing:
- **Database**: SQLite (`dev.db` file)
- **Superadmin Email**: `sadmin@hros.com`
- **Superadmin Password**: `Ompl@65482*`

The database is now seeded with sample data including departments, employees, roles, permissions, and recruitment jobs.

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Updated to use SQLite
- `backend/prisma/seed.js` - Fixed field mapping and seeding logic

### Frontend:
- `web/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - New authentication context
- `web/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - New route protection component
- `web/src/App.jsx` - Added auth provider and route protection
- `web/src/pages/Login.jsx` - Updated to use auth context
- `web/src/components/Header.jsx` - Added proper logout functionality

Both issues have been successfully resolved and the application now works as expected with proper authentication flow and database seeding.
