# Authentication Bug Fixes

## Problem
The application was bypassing the login screen and going directly to the dashboard, even when users were not authenticated. This was a critical security issue where authentication was not properly enforced.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that the backend was missing the `/api/auth/me` endpoint that the frontend was calling to verify authentication status. This caused the authentication check to fail silently, but the app wasn't properly handling the failure.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Backend Authentication Fixes

#### Added Missing Authentication Endpoint
- **File:** `backend/index.js`
- **Added:** `/api/auth/me` endpoint with JWT verification
- **Purpose:** Allows the frontend to verify if the current token is valid

#### Added JWT Verification Middleware
- **File:** `backend/index.js`
- **Added:** `authenticateToken` middleware function
- **Features:**
  - Extracts JWT token from Authorization header
  - Verifies token with secret key
  - Validates session consistency
  - Handles token expiration

#### Enhanced Session Management
- **Added:** `express-session` package for server-side session management
- **Features:**
  - Session cookie configuration
  - Session storage with user ID and email
  - Session destruction on logout
  - CORS configuration with credentials support

#### Added Proper Logout Endpoint
- **File:** `backend/index.js`
- **Added:** `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
- **Features:**
  - Destroys server-side session
  - Clears session cookies
  - Proper cleanup on logout

### 2. Frontend Authentication Fixes

#### Enhanced Authentication Context
- **File:** `web/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- **Improvements:**
  - Added token expiration checking
  - Automatic token validation every 5 minutes
  - Proper error handling for failed authentication
  - Session state management

#### Fixed Authentication State Management
- **Enhanced:** Token validation flow
- **Added:** Client-side token expiration checking
- **Improved:** Error handling and state cleanup

#### Added Request Credentials
- **Updated:** All API calls to include `credentials: 'include'`
- **Purpose:** Ensures session cookies are sent with requests

#### Protected Route Enhancement
- **File:** `web/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`
- **Already properly implemented:** Redirects to login when not authenticated

### 3. Security Improvements

#### Token Validation
- JWT tokens are now properly validated on both client and server
- Token expiration is checked before making API calls
- Automatic logout when tokens expire

#### Session Security
- HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Secure cookies in production environment
- Session timeout configuration (24 hours)

#### CORS Security
- Properly configured CORS with credentials support
- Frontend origin validation

## How It Works Now

1. **Initial Load:**
   - App checks for stored JWT token
   - If token exists, verifies it's not expired
   - Calls `/api/auth/me` to validate with server
   - If validation fails, redirects to login

2. **Login Process:**
   - User enters credentials
   - Backend validates credentials
   - Creates JWT token and server session
   - Frontend stores token and updates auth state
   - Redirects to dashboard

3. **Authenticated State:**
   - All API calls include JWT token in headers
   - Server validates token on each request
   - Session is maintained on server side
   - Periodic token expiration checks

4. **Logout Process:**
   - Calls backend logout endpoint
   - Destroys server session
   - Clears client-side token
   - Redirects to login page

## Testing the Fix

The authentication system will now:
- ✅ Always require login on first visit
- ✅ Maintain session across page refreshes
- ✅ Automatically logout when tokens expire
- ✅ Properly handle authentication failures
- ✅ Redirect unauthenticated users to login page

## Security Benefits

1. **Proper Authentication Flow:** Users must authenticate before accessing protected routes
2. **Session Management:** Server-side sessions prevent token tampering
3. **Token Validation:** Both client and server validate tokens
4. **Automatic Cleanup:** Expired tokens are automatically removed
5. **CORS Protection:** Proper origin validation for cross-origin requests
